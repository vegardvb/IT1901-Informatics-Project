## Building and running the app
The project utilizes maven for building and running.

Before running the app, it needs to be built.

1. Building is done with `mvn install` from the app's root folder [**/bibtek/**](/bibtek)

    (additionally `-Dfast` is used to skip *surefire* tests, *checkstyle* and *spotbugs*, and `-DskipIntegrationTests` to skip *failsafe* integration tests)

2. Running the app is done through the fxui module with the command `mvn javafx:run -f fxui`

3. Running back-end is done through the restserver module with the command `mvn exec:java -f restserver`
